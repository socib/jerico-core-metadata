# jerico-core-metadata

The Coastal Ocean Resource Environment (CORE) is the e-infrastructure of The Joint European Research Infrastructure of Coastal Observatories (JERICO) Research Infrastructure (RI). This system is built over a catalog of linked resources of the coastal ocean community. The metadata information of the resource catalog is harvested automatically from various providers or through json files describing the metadata of the catalog entities. The latest option allow including metadata information that cannot be harvested automatically from the providers or complementing or fixing metadata from the providers.

This repository contains the json files describing this additional information. The template directory includes json templates file that may be used as a baseline to edit new metadata. The metadata directory contains the json files with the metadata.
